# Traceware
This project is a Python-based monitoring tool that logs user activity, including system startup and shutdown events, active window changes, and keystrokes. The tool sends real-time logs to a Discord webhook, differentiating each type of log with color-coded messages. It also captures the user's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for tracking purposes.
